# Dhiqrah M. Essa – Portfolio

This is a personal portfolio website showcasing research in microbiology, community-focused STEM initiatives, and leadership roles.

Built with simple HTML and CSS and intended for hosting on GitHub Pages.

## How to publish

1. Create a repository on GitHub (for example `dhiqrah-portfolio` or `dhiqrah.github.io` if you want a user site).
2. Push these files to the repository root on the `main` branch.
3. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings (Source: `main` branch, root).

If you want, I can create the repository and push the files for you — tell me your GitHub username and whether you'd like a user site (`username.github.io`) or a project site.
